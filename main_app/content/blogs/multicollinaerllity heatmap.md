title: Understanding Multicollinearity in Machine Learning  
date: 2024-06-26
published: True
shortDesc: Multicollinearity can be a major concern in machine learning models, especially in linear regression models. It occurs when two or more predictor variables (features) are highly correlated, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates of regression coefficients.
