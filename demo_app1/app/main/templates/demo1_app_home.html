            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction Web App, a powerful tool designed to help you assess the risk of heart disease based on a set of clinical parameters. This application leverages advanced machine learning models to provide accurate predictions and valuable insights into heart health.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> You can provide clinical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, and other relevant features.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Once you submit the data, the application uses a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Results:</strong> The prediction is displayed on the web page and also sent to the email address you provide. Additionally, all prediction data and results are stored in a cloud database for further analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Easily enter patient data using intuitive input forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Notifications:</strong> Receive prediction results directly to your email.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> All data and results are securely stored in a cloud database.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalable Deployment:</strong> The app is deployed on Azure, ensuring high availability, security  and reliability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>The application is built using:</p>
