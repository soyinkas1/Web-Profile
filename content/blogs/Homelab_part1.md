As more and more people work from home, having a homelab setup has become increasingly popular. A homelab can be a great way to learn new technologies, experiment with different software and hardware configurations, and even run personal projects. In this blog post, I'll share my own homelab setup, including the hardware and software I use.

### Hardware:

My homelab setup consists of the following hardware:

1.  HP ProLiant MicroServer Gen10 Plus: This is the heart of my homelab. It's a compact and powerful server that can handle a variety of workloads. It has an AMD Opteron X3421 CPU, 32GB of RAM, and 4 x 4TB hard drives in a RAID 10 configuration.
2.  Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine Pro: This is my network gateway, firewall, and WiFi access point. It provides me with a variety of network features and security options.
3.  Netgear 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch: This switch connects all of my devices to the network.
4.  Raspberry Pi 4: This small computer runs a variety of services for me, including Pi-hole (a network-level ad blocker) and Home Assistant (a home automation platform).

### Software:

I use a variety of software on my homelab setup, including:

1.  Proxmox VE: This is my hypervisor of choice. It allows me to run virtual machines and containers on my server. I currently have several VMs running, including a Windows 10 VM for gaming and a Ubuntu Server VM for running various services.
2.  Docker: I use Docker to run various services, including Nextcloud (a self-hosted cloud storage solution), GitLab (a self-hosted Git repository), and Portainer (a Docker management tool).
3.  pfSense: This is my firewall and router software. It provides me with a variety of security features, including VPN access and intrusion detection.
4.  Home Assistant: This is my home automation platform. I use it to control various smart devices in my home, including lights, cameras, and smart plugs.

Overall, my homelab setup provides me with a lot of flexibility and the ability to experiment with new technologies. It's also a great way to learn new skills and keep up with the latest trends in IT. If you're interested in setting up your own homelab, I recommend starting with a small server and gradually adding hardware and software as needed. With a little bit of effort, you can create a powerful and flexible homelab that meets your needs.
